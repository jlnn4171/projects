<p>After getting her associates in cosmetics in the late 90s, she has worked in various salons before opening her first salon in Providence. She sold that business after 5 years to be with family for while before opening Perfect Nails with her husband closer to home. The community she built at her previous salon followed her to her new salon.</p>
<p>To continue evolving her business, she begun to pursue another certification in 2012 for permanent makeup and eyelash extensions. Now offering a variety of services that people usually have to go to different locations for, Perfect Nails can become anyone's one stop salon.</p>
